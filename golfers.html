                <p>The captain of Team USA. Anthony needs to dial in his iron play if he hopes to lead his team to victory.
                    It's very possible he will face off against his counterpart Brian Busch and if he 
                    is not mentally ready for that matchup, things could go south fast. He has made some swing adjustments
                    in the offseason so we will see if they pay off. USA! USA! USA!

                                <p>Biggest Weakness: Driver</p>
                                <p>The doctor will see you now. Barnes hasn't been able to golf as much the past few years 
                                    and that is the biggest question mark with his game right now because we know
                                    he has good speed on the greens. When it comes to getting off of the tee box, 
                                    well it seems he can never finish. Very punny I know. Barnes could
                                    be a steal with his high HCP, but he still has to play 
                                    well and that may be a challenge since he will be playing 
                                    almost that same as last season. Expect Tyler to go in the mid rounds of the draft.

                        <p>Taylor has gone through a number of injury woes so that will be something
                            to keep an eye on throughout this weekend because nobody knows how his foot/ankle 
                            will hold up for four rounds. Other than that, this is a golfer that loves to compete.
                            He prefers to golf when temps are near freezing, so warm weather could harm his game. This is 
                            one of this weekend's top golfers.

                            plans on letting him get in some practice time on the range before the tournament begins.
                            His game has improved greatly ever since joining the "Beers and Bogeys" golf league, but 
                            the inconsistencies in the tee box are rightfully concerning. We expect Justin to be
                            taken later in the draft, but could wind up being a steal.

                          Dad in this tournament, so you have to account for the dad strength that this golfer

                            least, he will bring good laughs to his team and can be his teams glue guy. We expect

                            that actually played high school golf and he knows more about golf than you will ever hope to know.
                            If he can stay even keeled, he will be a big factor for his team. We expect him to go high in the draft.

                        with his high handicap, he can steal plenty of holes if he plays some decent golf. He has the captains
                        really scratching their heads at where to take him, but we still project him to be taken late in the draft.

                        <h2>Kirk May</h2>
                        <p>HCP: 20 / Shoots: Right</p>
                        <p>Biggest Weakness: His Slice</p>
                        <p>Kirk has two very unique attributes to his game: His wicked slice and his
                            tap tap tapping of the club during his takeaway. Don't let this fool you, he is still
                            a very solid golfer. We have seen Kirk go off the 
                            rails while golfing, most notably almost throwing his pitching wedge through a
                            window, but he can still hit it with the best of em. We expect Kirk to be taken in the mid rounds.

                        <p>David is known for his split personality Jekyll and Hyde on the golf course so it will
                            be interesting to see who shows up for the tournament. His driver can be considered a 
                            deadly weapon if he is on, so his team hopes this is what they get. He has been known
                            to get into it with the booze so this is another thing to keep an eye on. We expect David to
                            be taken high in the draft.

                        <p>Biggest Weakness: Irons</p>
                        <p>Brent has pulled off some remarkable shots, including a 90 degree iron shot off of the tee
                            box. He thrives on the greens and has nerves of steel to sink difficult putts. He regressed
                            a bit last season, but with a new job and a new house his attitude will be better than ever.
                            With a high HCP, he could be a late round gem. We expect Brent to go in the mid-late rounds.

                        <p>Biggest Weakness: Beer</p>
                        <p>Big Pete is here for a good time, not a long time. The host of the Ryder Cup needs
                            to pace himself because this will be the most golf he has ever played in one weekend.
                            Boasting the second highest handicap, he has plently of untapped skill that may
                            surpise some of the other golfers in the field. He has a solid driver, but the question is 
                            can he limit his beer intake? We expect Pete to go late in the draft.

                        <p>Biggest Weakness: ?</p>
                        <p>Bill comes into the Ryder Cup as the top golfer and the lowest handicap.
                            His calming presence will be tested at the Wargo cottage as it is sure to 
                            get rowdy. He will have to stay focused if he hopes to stay on top of his game.
                            With such a low HCP, it will be interesting to see if he is taken first overall or not.
                            It's hard to find a flaw in his game, so we will go with TBD for his biggest weakness.
